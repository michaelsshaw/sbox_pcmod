# Shader instructions:

The texture file is broken into a 12x12 grid containing all the ascii characters in order.  Each character must occupy the *entire* frame it belongs to.

Each character will fill the appropriate slot on the screen. If the screen dimensions are not 1:1, character will appear stretched; author texture to compensate.
